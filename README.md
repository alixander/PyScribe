[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alixander/PyScribe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alixander/PyScribe) [![Latest Version](https://pypip.in/version/pyscribe/badge.svg?text=version)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyscribe/) [![Supported Python versions](https://pypip.in/py_versions/pyscribe/badge.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyscribe/)

A Python library to make debugging with print statements simpler and more effective.

[PyScribe.com](http://pyscribe.com) for full documentation. (Work in progress)

*Warning*: This project is currently in a pre-release state. Open to contributions and collaborators.

Installation
------------
To install pyscribe:
```bash
$ pip install pyscribe
```
It may be necessary to have root privileges, in which case:
```bash
$ sudo pip install pyscribe
```
To uninstall:
```bash
$ pip uninstall pyscribe
```

Usage
------
1. Include `from pyscribe import pyscribe` at the top of the files you are debugging.
2. Initialize a variable of your choice to `pyscribe.Scriber()` (E.g.: `ps = pyscribe.Scriber()`)
3. Make API calls as needed. (E.g.: `ps.p(x)`)
4. Run one of the following commands
```bash
$ pyscribe myfile.py
 ```
 This is the equivalent of running `$ python myfile.py` with all calls desugared.

```bash
$ pyscribe myfile.py --extraargs "-u asdf"
```
This is the equivalent of running `$ python myfile.py -u asdf` with all calls desugared.

```bash
$ pyscribe myfile.py --desugared
```
This does not run anything, but rather outputs a myfile_desugared.py, which is intended to be run to debug.


Argument Options
-----------------
- `--extraargs` -- Arguments intended to be passed to Python file when run. Must be called with --run set
- `--clean` -- Produce a clean version of the file with all references to PyScribe removed 
- `--desugared` -- Produce a desugared version of the file with all API calls replaced with valid Python.
- `--log` -- Save logs to a pyscribe_log.txt file along with timestamp.
- `--nolines` -- Don't show line numbers.

API Calls
----------
- `pyscribe.Scriber(labels=[])` -- Initialize PyScribe. If you're scribing values with labels, you can filter by labels by passing in a list of the labels as strings.
- `pyscribe.p(object, label=None)` -- Print the object value with relevant info dependent on type
- `pyscribe.iterscribe(object)` -- Log the object value from inside a for or while loop which prints current iteration
- `pyscribe.watch(object)` -- Log the object whenever its value changes
- `pyscribe.d(object, unit="*")` -- Distinguish the log with a clear separator defined by the unit

Planned
----------
- `pyscribe.values(object)` -- Log the internal values of lists and dictionaries in a pretty way
- `pyscribe.props(object)` -- Log the fields of an object and their values
- Add configurations for the logging messages. e.g. `Line 9: x is 4` instead of `From line 9: x is the int 4`.
- `pyscribe make` -- Command line instruction to search python files in current directory, desugar all files using pyscribe, replace files with desugared version, store old version in temporary directory.
- `pyscribe debug` -- Command line instruction to find any desugared pyscribe files, replace them with counterparts in temporary directory.
- `pyscribe clean` -- Command line instruction to find python files using pyscribe and replace them with a clean version. Erase debug versions unless told otherwise. --save-debug or something.

Tests
----------
Test modules are in the `tests` directory. Specific test cases are in these modules in the form of `testcase.py`, and the test runner compares these with `testcase_correct`. Run the tests with `./run_tests`.

Example
--------
#####test.py:
```python
from pyscribe import pyscribe

def main():
    ps = pyscribe.Scriber()

    x = 5
    ps.p(x)

    bar = "foo"
    for i in xrange(5):
        bar += str(i)
        ps.iterscribe(bar)

    y = "hello"
    ps.p(y)
    ps.watch(y)

    y = "world"

    foo = 1234
    ps.d(foo)
    ps.d(foo, unit="^")

    synonyms = {"clerk": "secretary", "student": "apprentice", "ground": "floor"}
    ps.p(synonyms)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
